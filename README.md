# MCP Registry - Index

This repository contains the metadata index for MCP (Model Context Protocol) packages.

Each entry in `entries/` is a JSON file with metadata for an MCP package, validated against the JSON Schema defined in `schema/metadata.schema.json`.
The `dist/index.json` file is generated by `npm run build` and contains the consolidated list of all entries.

## How to send Your MCP to the Index

Want to add a new MCP package to the index? Follow these steps:

### 1. Create your entry
- Create a new JSON file in `entries/`.
- The filename must be unique in format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.SSSZ.json` (e.g., `2025-05-08T08:42:27.945Z.json`).
- Fill in the content according to the schema in `schema/metadata.schema.json`.

### 2. Validate your entry
- Run the following command to make sure your file matches the schema:
  ```bash
  npm run validate
  ```
- Fix any errors reported by the validation.

### 3. Open your Pull Request (PR)
- Fork this repository and create a new branch.
- Add your JSON file to `entries/`.
- In the PR description, briefly explain your package and include:
  - Package name
  - Author
  - Link to repository/documentation
- Wait for the team review.

#### Best Practices
- Always validate your file before opening the PR.
- Review the schema documentation to ensure all required fields are present.
- Use unique filenames to avoid conflicts.
- Be clear in your PR description.
