# MCP Registry

This repository contains the metadata registry for MCP (Model Context Protocol) packages.

Each entry in `entries/` is a JSON file containing metadata for an MCP package, validated against the JSON Schema defined in `schema/metadata.schema.json`.

The `dist/index.json` file is generated by `npm run build` and contains the consolidated list of all entries.
